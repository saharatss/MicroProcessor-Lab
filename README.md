## Content

There are topics of my works

### Week 1 - Arduino Register
[go to Week1](https://github.com/earthsaharat/MicroProcessor-Lab/tree/master/Week1)

### Week 2 - IC 8-Bit Shift Registers

IC 74HC595 - 8-Bit Serial-In, Parallel-Out Shift

### Week 4 - 7-Segment display

A seven-segment display is a form of electronic display device for displaying decimalnumerals that is an alternative to the more complex dot matrix displays. Seven-segment displaysare widely used in digital clocks, electronic meters, basic calculators, and other electronicdevices that display numerical information.

### Week 5 - SPI and 7-Segment

Serial  Peripheral  Interface  (SPI)  is  a  synchronous  serial  data  protocol  used  by microcontrollers  for communicating  with  one  or  more  peripheral  devices  quickly  over  short distances. It can also be used for communication between two microcontrollers.

### Week 6 - I2C - Real Time Clock (RTC)

I2C combines the best features of SPI and UARTs. With I2C, you canconnect multiple slaves to a single master (like SPI) and you can have multiple masters controlling single, or multiple slaves. This isreally useful when you want to have more than one microcontroller.

real-time clock (RTC) is a low-power, full binary-coded decimal (BCD) clock/calendar plus 56 bytes of NV SRAM. Address and data are transferred serially through an I²C.

### Week 7 - I2C - OLED

### Week 8 - UART - Software Serial

UART stands for Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter. It’s not a communicationprotocol like SPI and I2C, but a  physical circuit in a microcontroller, or a stand-alone IC. AUART’s main purpose is to transmit and receive serial data.
